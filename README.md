# epapi
The lightweight Discord plugin framework

## How do I install this?
EPAPI requires a bootstrap to function. There's currently no documentation, so you'll need to read through epapi.js to figure out how this all works.

## Recommended bootstraps
- For the bleeding-edge EPAPI5 (what is hosted on this repo), [EndPwn3](https://endpwn.github.io/endpwn3/) is recommended.
- If you want to use the older, but more stable EPAPI4, [bootsyhax](http://super.fuck.world/) is recommended.
